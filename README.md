## 🎯 Project Highlights

### Sephora Beauty Analytics
**Problem:** Beauty e-commerce platform needs to optimize pricing strategy and understand customer sentiment across 8.5K products

**Approach:** Built end-to-end ML pipeline with transformer-based NLP, hybrid recommendation system, and 3 predictive models

**Impact:**
- 📈 Identified 20-30% price increase opportunity for travel-size products
- 🎯 Discovered 90% category-first navigation behavior (contradicts brand-first merchandising)
- 🔧 Flagged device category for quality audit (40%+ negative sentiment)
- 💡 Found brand positioning drives 85% of pricing power (r=0.08 price-quality correlation)

**Technical Achievement:** Processed 1M+ reviews with DistilBERT (87.7% confidence), handled 99.7% sparse user-item matrix, achieved 0.69-0.71 AUC on predictive models

### Spotify Streaming Analytics
**Problem:** Music streaming platforms need to understand what drives song popularity and optimize playlist curation

**Approach:** Statistical analysis of 114K tracks using correlation analysis, ANOVA, clustering, and hypothesis testing

**Impact:**
- 🎵 Discovered "sweet spot" effect: tracks with danceability >0.7 AND energy >0.7 achieve 2.35x higher popularity (77.7 vs 33.3 avg)
- 📊 Genre matters more than audio features: emo (48.1) outperforms reggaeton (23.9) by 100%
- 🔍 Individual features show minimal correlation with popularity (r<0.10), challenging assumption that "better sounding" = more popular
- 💡 Explicit content shows modest 10.6% lift, likely confounded by genre

**Technical Achievement:** Rigorous statistical testing (Pearson, ANOVA F=132-373, t-tests, chi-square), professional visualizations, reproducible analysis
