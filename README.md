## 🎯 Sephora Analytics Deep Dive

**Business Context:** Beauty e-commerce platform with 1M+ customer reviews across 8.5K products

**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Exploratory Analysis** — Statistical profiling, correlation testing, temporal trend analysis
2. **Sentiment Analysis** — Transformer-based NLP to classify 1M reviews (87.7% confidence)
3. **Recommendation Engine** — Hybrid system addressing cold-start and data sparsity challenges
4. **Predictive Modeling** — 3 models predicting product success, review helpfulness, and optimal pricing

**Key Findings:**
- **Pricing Disconnect:** Price and quality show almost no correlation (r=0.083)
- **Brand Power:** Brand positioning drives 85% of pricing decisions, not product features
- **User Behavior:** 90% category-first navigation—contradicts brand-first merchandising strategy
- **Quality Gaps:** Device/tool products show 40%+ negative sentiment vs. 25% for skincare

**Business Impact:**
- 📈 Identified 20-30% price increase opportunity for travel-size products
- 🎯 Recommended category-first product discovery redesign
- 🔧 Flagged device category for quality audit (highest complaint rate)
- ⭐ Defined review helpfulness drivers to surface better content

**Technical Highlights:**
- Processed 1M+ text records with DistilBERT transformer model
- Built hybrid recommendation system (60% collaborative + 40% content-based)
- Trained 3 models with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Handled 99.7% sparse user-item matrix for collaborative filtering
