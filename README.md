# Nischala Nagisetty — Data & Machine Learning Portfolio

I build end-to-end machine learning and analytics systems that translate complex data into measurable business outcomes. My work spans statistical analysis, transformer-based NLP, recommendation systems, and supervised learning with an emphasis on production-grade methodology, cross-validation, and interpretability.

I am currently focused on roles in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Product Insights across high-impact technology domains.

## Featured Work

### 🧴 Sephora Beauty Analytics — ML Pipeline + Recommendations + Pricing Insights
**End-to-end machine learning system analyzing 1M+ beauty product reviews to uncover pricing strategy, customer sentiment drivers, and category-level quality patterns.**

**Key technical components**
• Transformer-based sentiment analysis (DistilBERT) with BERTopic taxonomy  
• Hybrid recommendation system combining SVD collaborative filtering + TF-IDF content similarity  
• Predictive modeling for product success, review helpfulness, and price positioning  
• Cross-validated training, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis  

**Scale & Outcomes**
• 1,092,953 reviews | 8,494 products | 105,566 users  
• AUC: 0.69 (product success) | 0.71 (review helpfulness) | R²: 0.58 (price prediction)  

**Selected Findings**
• Price ≠ quality (r = 0.083); brand positioning explains 85.5% of pricing power  
• 5.3× increase in digital engagement post-2020  
• Category-first browsing patterns (>90% of navigation paths)  
• Device/tool category shows the highest negative sentiment (40%+)  

**Business Recommendations**
• Reprice mini/travel SKUs upward (~20–30% opportunity)  
• Restructure discovery around category-first behavior  
• Audit device/tool category for QA + labeling improvements  
• Surface long-form extreme reviews to boost decision quality  

**Tech**
Python, PyTorch, Transformers, BERTopic, XGBoost, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
