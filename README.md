# Nischala Nagisetty

Data professional specializing in statistical modeling, machine learning, and exploratory analysis. I build systems that extract actionable insights from complex datasets.

Currently open to data science and analytics roles.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Key Results | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Twitch Elite Creator Analytics** | Multi-model ML system predicting mega-streamer status and identifying creator personas among 1,000 elite Twitch creators | 0.924 ROC-AUC classification • Engagement paradox discovered (rho=-0.50) • 5 distinct personas with 64% mega-rate for top segment • $1.8M estimated partnership savings | Python, scikit-learn, K-Means, Logistic Regression, scipy |
| **Sephora Beauty Analytics** | ML pipeline analyzing 1M+ reviews to identify pricing strategies and sentiment patterns | Brand positioning drives 85% of pricing variance • 90% category-first user behavior • Identified 30% pricing opportunity in travel sizes | Python, DistilBERT, XGBoost, BERTopic, scikit-learn |
| **Spotify Streaming Analytics** | Statistical analysis of 114K tracks to understand popularity drivers and optimize playlists | High danceability + energy tracks show 2.35x popularity • Genre explains 100% variance (emo 48.1 vs reggaeton 23.9) • Individual features r<0.10 | Python, pandas, scipy, statistical testing |

## Technical Skills

**Languages & Frameworks** Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, transformers), SQL (Snowflake, PostgreSQL), R (dplyr, ggplot2)

**Machine Learning & Statistics** Supervised learning (XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression), unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering), NLP (BERT, sentiment analysis, topic modeling), recommendation systems, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, ANOVA, chi-square tests, A/B testing

**Data Engineering & Tools** ETL pipelines (dbt, Apache Airflow), AWS Lambda, Tableau, Git, Jupyter

## Approach

I focus on rigorous statistical methodology and translating findings into specific business recommendations. My work emphasizes proper hypothesis testing, identifying confounding variables, and model interpretability.
