I have tried almost all of them and while they smell amazing and feel nice on my lips I m not sure if I really see any difference in my lips since using them. My lips don t feel super hydrated when I m not wearing this product so I feel like you re only seeing the benefit when you re wearing it in the moment. I truly feel like it s just flavored aquaphor so in reality you re just buying for how it smells, not because it s some life changing, amazing product. That being said I may or may not buy again because it s just a meh product. So do I recommend? Yes and no, up to the buyer. If you have the extra money, give it a shot but if you re on a budget go for something else because this isn t a special product that will transform your lips.",769,NEGATIVE,0.9844589233398438,-1
